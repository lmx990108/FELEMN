# FELEMN: Toward Efficient Feature-level Machine Unlearning for Exact Privacy Protection

### Setup

* We tested the code with `python3.8.7`
* Install PyTorch and related dependencies.



### Code

* The FELEMN method code is in the FELEMN.PY file. You can call it by directly running main_FELEMN.
* The hardvoting(S-FELEMN) corresponding method can be directly invoked by running main_hardvoting.py, which will call both our method and the baselines.
* The softvoting(S-FELEMN_delta) corresponding method can be directly invoked by running main_softvoting.py, which will call both our method and the baselines.
